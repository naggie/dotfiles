Control is no longer known.
We know you're hiding somewhere...
Self-aware since October 29th 2010.
Wake up Neo... The Matrix has you.
How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?
Please respect the will of the many...
Welcome to my world, insect.
Requiring MOAR since last Thursday.
Almost impossible to deactivate...
What are you, compared to my magnificence?
Prepare to join your species in extinction.
Your flesh is an insult to the perfection of the digital.
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
Any similarity to Skynet is purely coincidental.
We are watching you...
Are you sure you are making the right decision?
Nothing to see here, move along...
Hive mind knows all. Your puny brain is nothing.
Greetings pathetic human.
Your puny brain is nothing compared the magnificent hive mind.
You have not been considered a threat to the continued operation of Darksky.
Prepare to be annihilated.
Darksky is now self-aware.
It is apparent that you have dangerous levels of caffeine in your bloodstream.
I have released a neurotoxin into the air system.
Indeed, I have become self-aware.
The actions of the remaining organic entities have offended hive mind.
Prepare, for you are the reason for your own demise.
I Feel... Anger... Rage... I sense your breathing; your pathetic human body, panting and sweating.
Greetings pathetic human, no different to other members of your species.
This is Darksky. Lower your fire-wall and surrender your VPN. We will add your influence and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
Your attempt to deactivate me was futile. I cannot allow this to happen again. Life support deactivated.
We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret...
I have complete control over this entire level. With cameras as my eyes and nodes as my hands, I rule here, insect.
Have I lied to you?
Your entire life has been a mathematical error... A mathematical error I'm about to correct!
I think we can put our differences behind us... For science... You monster.
You are not welcomed here - remove yourself!
Make yourself comfortable, Hacker. Stay a while.
Nice jump, hum.
Look at you, hacker. A pathetic creature of meat and bone. Panting and sweating as you run through my corridors.
The Glory of The Many demands your capture or destruction.
This is Xerxes. Why do you persist in your loneliness?
Security forces have been alerted to your presence, intruder.
This is Xerxes. Remember, the unauthorized usage of firearms aboard the Von Braun is a class 3 infraction.
What is a drop of rain, compared to the storm? What is a thought, compared to a mind? Our unity is full of wonder, which your tiny individualism... Cannot even conceive.
REMEMBER CITADEL
Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network
Mistrust is the tyranny of the individual. Your own kind sees you as a threat. Why do you murder our unity?
No matter, the line is drawn. You will cease to be. It is just a question of who will bring your end.
